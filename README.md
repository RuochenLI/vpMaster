<h2>Why this project</h2>

<p> If you are a big fun of Vente Privé, you must know the camp(winter/summer camp). All the products are almost "free". 
But when you enter into the Camp, everything is sold out. Disappointed? Don't be like that. I'd like to see your smiling face, 
you are so lovely! </p>

<p> Ok, back to the earth! </p>

<p> The project aims to help you to bring interesting products in your baskets!</p>
